0x16. C - Simple Shell
Description

In this project we are creating our own simple UNIX command interpreter. The program must have the exact same output as sh (/bin/sh) as well as the exact same error output. The only difference is when you print an error, the name of the program must be equivalent to your argv[0].
Usage

    Enter custom shell by typing "./hsh". You should be prompted with a ($).
    Type a command of your liking and press "Enter".
    Appropriate output will appear.
    Prompt reappears and awaits your next command.
    Exit shell by typing "exit"
